# TicTacToe
Using Minimax,I have implement an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe.
### Execute [runner.py](https://github.com/parijaat007/TicTacToe/blob/master/runner.py) in python shell to play a game of Tic Tac Toe with an exceptionally intelligent AI

This is an implementation of the classic game of tic-tac-toe using Minimax algorithm.
[tictactoe.py](https://github.com/parijaat007/TicTacToe/blob/master/tictactoe.py) contains all of the logic for playing the game, and for making optimal moves.
The python module pygame is necessary to run this program. You can install the same using [pip3 install pygame]
